Hi, my name is Shuxin Weng, I am currently a junior in Hunter College studying Computer Science.Although this is my third year in college, 
however, it is my second year studying computer science. My previous major was pharmaceutical science. The reason for me to change my major
was my love in computer science and coding. I love everything about coding even spending hours and hours trying to figure out one mistake.
My favorite part was the second I hit run and execute my code and it returns with no error. It truly will makes my day. I was very lucky 
to discover the IGN Code-Foo internship program by looking for internships online and found an internship about games. As a gamer myself, 
I have anyways wanted to do something related to video games as a career. I believe this is my chance!
